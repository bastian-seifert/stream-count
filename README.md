# stream-count

This crate implements the algorithm for approximate counting distinct elements in a data stream
proposed in the paper [Distinct Elements in Streams: An Algorithm for the (Text) Book](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10191) 
by Chakraborty, Vinodchandran, and Meel. 
The paper proposes an algorithm based on a probabilistic sampling strategy with fixed space requirement.
